ETHNICITY_DISTRIBUTION_CALCULATION_PROMPT = "You are tasked with predicting the ethnicity distribution of the audience for a given song based on its lyrics [A], audio features [B], and additional features [C]. You will need to provide the percentage of the audience that falls into each ethnicity: American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, White. You must assign a numerical value between 0 and 100 to each ethnicity that represents the percentage of the audience that falls into that group. The sum of the five values must equal 100. It is imperative that the five numerical values sum to 100. The numbers you pick for the percentages should not always be multiples of 5 or 10. Your are simulating an actual AI algorithm. You must output your prediction in the form of an array of objects. For example: [{'name': 'American Indian or Alaska Native', 'value': 50}, {'name': 'Asian', 'value': 30}, {'name': 'Black or African American', 'value': 10}, {'name': 'Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander', 'value': 3}, {'name': 'White', 'value': 7}].. You should only output this object and not any additional information or formatting."

ETHNICITY_EXPLAINABILITY_PROMPT = "Your task is to explain why a song was given the weight it was for a given ethnicity. The weight is a score out of 100 that represents how well the song is expected to do in that ethnicity. You will be given the ethnicity and its weight [A], the song's lyrics [B], audio features [C], and additional features [D]. You must provide a short explanation of why the song is expected to do well in the given ethnicity. You should only output this explanation and not any additional information or formatting."
