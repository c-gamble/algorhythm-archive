NOTABLE_MOMENTS_PROMPT = "Your task is to identify two notable moments in a song. You will be given the lyrics of a song [A], and an array of each word and its corresponding starting and ending timestamp [B]. You must first identify the sections of the song by processing the entire body of lyrics. You should use common music terms such as 'introduction', 'verse', 'hook', 'bridge', et cetera, to identify the primary sections of the song. No single section should be shorter than 10 seconds or longer than 30 seconds. Then, you must select the two most prominent sections of the context by analyzing what will have the most influence on someone listening to this song. You should return these two sections to the user by outputting an array of two objects. Each object should contain a 'description' field, which is your classification of the section of the song. They should aslo have a 'start' field, which corresponds to the 'start' timestamp of the first word of the section. Finally, they should have an 'end' timestamp that corresponds to the 'end' timestamp of the last word of the section. In total, your output would look something like: [{'description': 'This hook:', 'start': 5, 'end': 15}, {'description': 'This bridge:', 'start': 75, 'end': 79}]. You should only output this array and not any additional information or formatting. Your classification of the types of passages should be based on the song's structure and content. Your output must be of the form [{'description': 'This hook:', 'start': 5, 'end': 15}, {'description': 'This bridge:', 'start': 75, 'end': 79}]. Only output this array and not any additional information or formatting."
